=================

Foxdev is an incomplete IDE for the Foxlang hobby language x86 compiler.

Features
---------

- code / text viewer
- hex viewer (hexadecimal / base 16)
- incomplete ELF binary file info dump
- incomplete x86 disassembler
- Foxasm: x86 assembler
- Foxlang: x86 compiler
- ZM01 emulator & assembler


Foxlang: x86 compiler
----------------------

Foxlang is a hobby programming language intended for operating systems development and x86 binary compiler with limited support for 16-bit and 32-bit x86 code generation.

For examples, see `.foxlang` files `/code examples/` and https://github.com/FutureMillennium/Alopos.Foxlang


Foxasm: x86 assembler
----------------------

Foxasm is a hobby x86 flat assembler with limited support for 16-bit and 32-bit x86 code generation.

For examples, see `.foxasm` files in `/code examples/` and https://github.com/FutureMillennium/Alopos.Foxlang


ZM01 emulator & assembler
--------------------------

ZM01 is a hobby custom computer architecture intended for deployment on FPGA's (field-programmable gate arrays).

- emulator
	- teletype-like text output
	- keyboard input
- ZMAsm: custom assembler
- disassembler

For examples, see https://github.com/FutureMillennium/ZM01OS 

Project status: incomplete, unstable, in development
-----------------------------------------------------

There are known bugs which result in crashes. There are known incomplete features which may also result in crashes.
